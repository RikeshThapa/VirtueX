				<p>
					In our group we wish to develop software that would
					compile and process data collected through these devices to
					accurately reflect the bodily functions taking place in terms
					of the musculoskeletal system as the user conducts various
					motions. In compiling this data we will be able to present a
					clear, intuitive, user friendly rendering of the usersâ€™
					physiology, allowing them to see:
					
					<ul>
						<li>If they are performing the correct motion</li>
						<li>If they are applying tension to the correct parts of the body</li>
						<li>If there is unnecessary tension being applied to the wrong parts
							of the body</li>
						<li>Which form of movement would provide the least stress to
							already-injured areas of the body in the real time.</li>
					</ul>
