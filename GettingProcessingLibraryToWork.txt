Using Processing.exe for library uploaded:

-download Processing file from processing.org. get the version for your respective operating system.
-make a new folder called "sketchbook" (case sensitive) inside the "processing."
-inside "sketchbook" make folder called "libraries" (case sensitive)
-go to "kinect" folder in your main "VirtueX" folder
-copy "openkinect" in the "libraries" folder you made in processing>>sketchbook>>libraries


-Open processing.exe
- Go to file> preferences
-Go to Sketchbook location: make sure the location is pointing to the folder before the
library folder:
eg. in my case:
C:\Users\Rikesh\Documents\GitHub\VirtueX\processing\sketchbook\



-Now you should be able to run it.
